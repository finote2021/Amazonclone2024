 8. useReducer Hook and UseContextAPI explanation and example
    Here's a detailed explanation of useState, useReducer, and the Context API:

1. useState Hook

useState is a Hook that allows you to add React state to functional components. It takes an initial value as an argument and returns an array with two elements:

The current state value
A function to update the state value
Example:

js

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
import React, { useState } from 'eact';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
}
In this example, count is the current state value, and setCount is the function to update the state value.

2. useReducer Hook

useReducer is a Hook that allows you to manage state with a reducer function. It takes three arguments:

The initial state value
The reducer function
An optional initial action
useReducer returns an array with two elements:

The current state value
The dispatch function
Example:

js

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
import React, { useReducer } from 'eact';

const initialState = { count: 0 };

const counterReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, initialState);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })}>-</button>
    </div>
  );
}
In this example, state is the current state value, and dispatch is the function to send actions to the reducer.

3. Context API

The Context API is a way to share data between components without passing props down manually. It consists of three parts:

Context: A container that holds the shared data
Provider: A component that provides the context to its children
Consumer: A component that consumes the context
Example:

js

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
import React, { createContext, useContext } from 'eact';

const ThemeContext = createContext();

const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const theme = 'dark';

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
};

function Button() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);

  return <button style={{ backgroundColor: theme === 'dark'? '#333' : '#fff' }}>Click me!</button>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Button />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
In this example, ThemeContext is the context container, ThemeProvider is the provider component, and Button is the consumer component.

When to use each:

useState: Use when you need to manage simple state in a functional component.
useReducer: Use when you need to manage complex state with a reducer function.
Context API: Use when you need to share data between components without passing props down manually.
Key differences:

useState and useReducer are used for local state management, while the Context API is used for global state management.
useState is simpler and easier to use, while useReducer is more powerful and flexible.
The Context API is more complex and requires more boilerplate code, but it provides a way to share data between components in a more scalable way.
